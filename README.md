You called it, we call you on it. 


No open source/low cost API for sports team's schedules/game results when I began this project, so I built one. NCAABBallScraper.py 
will search ESPN for ncaa teams, schedules, and results, and return that in  DICT object. 
ESPNScraper.py does the same for nba, nfl, nhl, and mlb teams, when fed one of those as a parameter. 

Similary for Odds.py, this scrapes VegasInsider.com for moneyline odds and matches it to those events scraped earlier when given 
and event as a parameter.
